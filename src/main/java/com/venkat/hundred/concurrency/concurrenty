Key Points:
Concurrency mechanisms like synchronized, ReentrantLock, Semaphore, and notify/wait are used to ensure thread safety and avoid race conditions.
System Design examples like the Elevator System and Rate Limiter demonstrate how to manage real-world systems with concurrency.
These programs handle common concurrency patterns. Let me know if you need further explanations or adjustments!
