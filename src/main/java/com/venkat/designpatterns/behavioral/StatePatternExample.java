/*
The State Pattern allows an object to change its behavior based on its current state.
In our example, the OrderState interface defines the common behavior for all order states.
Concrete states like "New", "Processed", "Shipped", and "Delivered" implement this interface,
each with their own specific behavior. The Order class (context) holds a reference to the current state
and uses setState() to switch states at runtime. When processOrder() is called, it delegates to the
current stateâ€™s handleOrder() method, making state transitions seamless without complex conditional logic.

    void handleOrder();

class NewOrderState implements OrderState {
    @Override
    public void handleOrder() {
        System.out.println("Order is now in NEW state.");
    }
}



// Concrete State: Shipped Order
class ShippedOrderState implements OrderState {
    @Override
    public void handleOrder() {
        System.out.println("Order is now in SHIPPED state.");
