The Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns are widely used in software development to solve common design problems. Here are the top 10 most used GoF design patterns, categorized by Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns:
Top 10 Design Patterns
===============================
1. Singleton (Creational)
Purpose: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
Use Cases:
Database Connection Pooling: Ensures only one instance of the connection pool is shared across the application to manage resources efficiently.
Logging Framework: Guarantees a single instance of the logging class is used for consistent logging.
Configuration Settings: Manages global configuration settings where only one instance exists to access or modify them.
2. Factory Method (Creational)
Purpose: Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
Use Cases:
Document Creation: Allows the creation of different document types (e.g., Word, PDF, Text) dynamically.
Shape Creation in Graphic Editors: Dynamically creates different shapes (e.g., Circle, Square, Rectangle).
Transport Logistics: Decides at runtime whether to create trucks, ships, or other transport types.
3. Abstract Factory (Creational)
Purpose: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Use Cases:
Cross-Platform UI: Creates families of UI components for different platforms (e.g., Windows or MacOS).
Vehicle Manufacturing: Creates related parts like electric or gas engines for vehicles.
Theme-Based GUI: Allows for different families of objects for light and dark themes (e.g., buttons, scrollbars).
4. Builder (Creational)
Purpose: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
Use Cases:
Building a Complex Report: Constructs a report with optional headers, footers, tables, and charts.
Meal Construction in Fast-Food Chains: Builds meals by selecting different combinations of components like drinks, sides, and desserts.
Creating a House: Builds houses with different rooms, doors, windows, etc.
5. Adapter (Structural)
Purpose: Converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects, enabling incompatible interfaces to work together.
Use Cases:
Legacy System Integration: Allows a modern application to communicate with a legacy system by adapting the interface.
Third-Party Library Integration: Adapts the interface of third-party libraries to fit the needs of your application.
Media Players: Converts different media formats (e.g., MP3, MP4) to a standard format that a media player can understand.
6. Decorator (Structural)
Purpose: Dynamically adds behavior to an object without modifying its structure.
Use Cases:
Adding Features to a Window: Adds features like scrollbars, borders, and resizing functionality dynamically.
Extending Java I/O Streams: Wraps an InputStream with a BufferedInputStream to add buffering.
Coffee Order System: Dynamically adds additional features (e.g., milk, sugar) to coffee objects.
7. Observer (Behavioral)
Purpose: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified and updated automatically.
Use Cases:
Real-Time Data Feeds (Stock Market): Notifies multiple subscribers when stock prices change.
User Interface Event Handling: Triggers updates in GUI components when an event (e.g., button click) occurs.
Publish-Subscribe Messaging Systems: Notifies multiple clients when a new event or message is published (e.g., in notification systems).
8. Strategy (Behavioral)
Purpose: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
Use Cases:
Payment Processing: Allows switching between multiple payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal) at runtime.
Sorting Algorithms: Enables dynamic selection of sorting algorithms (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort) based on data size or performance requirements.
Travel Route Calculation: Switches between different travel modes (e.g., car, bicycle, walking) in navigation systems.
9. Command (Behavioral)
Purpose: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing the parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and support for undoable operations.
Use Cases:
Undo/Redo in Text Editors: Encapsulates text operations as commands that can be undone or redone.
Remote Control Systems: Allows each button press to be encapsulated as a command for controlling different devices (e.g., TV, lights).
Task Scheduling: Queues up tasks to be executed later as individual commands in a scheduling system.
10. Proxy (Structural)
Purpose: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
Use Cases:
Lazy Initialization (Virtual Proxy): Delays the creation of heavy objects (e.g., large images) until they are actually needed.
Access Control (Protection Proxy): Controls access to sensitive objects by checking permissions before allowing access.
Remote Method Invocation (RMI): Acts as a proxy for objects located on remote servers, making them appear as if they are local.
These purposes and use cases provide a comprehensive understanding of how each design pattern is applied in real-world scenarios.
