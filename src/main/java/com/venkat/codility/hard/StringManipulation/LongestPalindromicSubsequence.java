o solve the Longest Palindromic Subsequence problem in Java, we can use dynamic programming. The longest palindromic subsequence problem involves finding the length of the longest subsequence in a given string that is also a palindrome.

Approach:
Define Subproblems:
Use a 2D DP array dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring s[i...j].
Base Cases:
A single character is a palindrome of length 1, so dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Fill the DP Array:
For substrings of length 2 and more, if the characters at both ends match (s[i] == s[j]), then dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2.
If the characters at both ends don‚Äôt match, then the result for dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i][j - 1].
Result:
The value dp[0][n-1] (where n is the length of the string) will contain the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string.


Explanation
Initialization:

Each single character is a palindromic subsequence of length 1, so dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Filling DP Array:

We consider all possible substring lengths (starting from 2 up to the length of the string).
For each substring, if the characters at the current ends i and j are equal, they contribute to the palindromic subsequence length, adding 2 to the result of the substring s[i + 1 ... j - 1].
If the characters do not match, the longest subsequence is the maximum length found by either moving i forward or j backward.
Result:

The final answer for the entire string‚Äôs longest palindromic subsequence is stored in dp[0][n-1].
Example
For the input string "bbbab":

Longest Palindromic Subsequence: "bbbb" (length 4)
Output:
