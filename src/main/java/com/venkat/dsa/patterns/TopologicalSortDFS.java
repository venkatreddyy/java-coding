Topological Sorting
Topological Sorting is an algorithm used to order the vertices of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge
ùë¢
‚Üí
ùë£
u‚Üív, vertex
ùë¢
u comes before vertex
ùë£
v in the ordering. This sorting is used in scenarios where a set of tasks must be performed in a specific order, such as scheduling jobs, building dependencies in software, or determining the order of compilation in programming languages.

Key Points:
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Topological sorting can only be performed on DAGs (graphs with directed edges and no cycles).
Ordering: Vertices are arranged so that for every directed edge
ùë¢
‚Üí
ùë£
u‚Üív,
ùë¢
u appears before
ùë£
v in the sorted order.
Multiple Solutions: A DAG can have multiple valid topological sorts.
Applications:
Task Scheduling
Course prerequisite problem
Determining compilation order in programming
Resolving dependencies
Approach:
There are two popular algorithms for topological sorting:

Kahn's Algorithm (using in-degree)
Depth-First Search (DFS) based approach
1. Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm (BFS-based):
This approach works by maintaining the in-degree of each vertex (the number of incoming edges to the vertex). It repeatedly removes vertices with zero in-degree (vertices that have no prerequisites) from the graph and reduces the in-degree of their neighbors.

Steps:
Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex.
Initialize a queue and add all vertices with an in-degree of zero.
Process each vertex from the queue by removing it and reducing the in-degree of its neighbors. If any neighbor‚Äôs in-degree becomes zero, add it to the queue.
Repeat until the queue is empty. If all vertices are processed, the topological sort is complete.
