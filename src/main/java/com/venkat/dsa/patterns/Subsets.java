Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that incrementally builds solutions to problems, and abandons a partial solution ("backtracks") if it determines that the solution cannot be completed to a valid solution. Backtracking is particularly useful for solving combinatorial and decision problems, such as generating all permutations, subsets, and solving puzzles like Sudoku or the N-Queens problem.

Key Concepts of Backtracking:
Recursive Approach: Backtracking typically involves recursive calls to explore all possible options.
Pruning: If a partial solution cannot be extended to a valid solution, the algorithm backtracks and tries another path (prunes the recursion tree).
State Space Tree: The problem is represented as a tree where each node represents a decision.
Common Problems Solved with Backtracking:
Generating all permutations or combinations of a set.
Solving constraint problems (e.g., N-Queens problem).
Subset sum problems.
Sudoku solving.
Example 1: Solving the N-Queens Problem
The N-Queens problem asks you to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other (no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal).

Approach:
We start by placing queens row by row.
At each step, we check if placing a queen in a given column is safe (i.e., it doesn't conflict with previously placed queens).
If placing a queen is safe, we move to the next row. If no valid positions are found in the current row, we backtrack to the previous row and try a different column.


All subsets:
[]
[1]
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 3]
[2]
[2, 3]
[3]
